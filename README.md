# Project
This project is based on the Mask_RCNN code

## Intent
The intention is to identify the drone landing pads from different heights and positions.
These were created using 3D modeling software such as Blender. In addition, the carpets were placed in a virtual context to recreate some typical amateur flight situations.
The camera settings to generate the images are those of the Raspberry Pi Cmaera V2.
The result is visible in the figure.
